# PyMuPDF-wheels
PyMuPDF wheels for all Python and Windows versions

Contains Python wheel versions for all PyMuPDF zip files in the [optional material repository](https://github.com/JorjMcKie/PyMuPDF-Optional-Material) for those who prefer the standard wheel format.

In an effort to control upload times, we are currently restricting ourselves to Python versions we have found to actually be in demand.

However, any version 2.7 or above is supported, so please record an issue if you are missing your case.
