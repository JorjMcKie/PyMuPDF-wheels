# PyMuPDF Wheels
**This repository is only used as an intermediate store.** Use [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/PyMuPDF/) or PyMuPDF's [releases folder](https://github.com/rk700/pymupdf/releases) instead to find the wheel you need.

This repository contains Python wheels of [PyMuPDF](https://github.com/pymupdf/PyMuPDF) generated by Travis CI for Linux and MAC OSX.
These are stored in branches `linux` and `osx`.

Update May 5, 2021:
I am now also generating wheels for the Linux ARM architecture. They land in branch ``linux-extra`` and are also uploaded to PyPI.
